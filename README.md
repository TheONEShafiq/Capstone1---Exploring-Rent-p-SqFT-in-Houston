# Capstone1-Data Exploration

In this first Capstone the main objective was to perform exploratory data analysis.  
Principal functions performed were data cleaning, data exploration and visualization
of some of the relationships.  

The data that I explored was historical rents per sq foot for single family residences in the Houston MSA.

The dataset was pulled from Zillow and covers over a decade of rents.
